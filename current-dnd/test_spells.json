Many common commands are detailed below. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends. • **Approach.** The target moves toward you by the safest and shortest available route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. • **Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and ends its turn. • **Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the safest and shortest available route. • **Grovel.** The target falls prone and then ends its turn. • **Halt.** The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to.",
