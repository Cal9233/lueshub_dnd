## 📋 Summary

The dnd-update React application has successfully implemented all core functionality from current-dnd:
1. Full authentication system
2. Complete character management
3. Advanced dice roller with 2D/3D views
4. DM-controlled audio system
5. Modern responsive UI

The only missing features are placeholder pages (Notes, Profile, Settings) that had no actual functionality in current-dnd either. The React version is ready to replace current-dnd as the main application.
